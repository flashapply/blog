**Amid a growing wave of job displacement, Jobago is quietly building something bold: a redefinition of what it means to support people after a layoff.** In a candid [conversation with Jobago’s CEO ↗](https://www.jobago.ai/post/interview-with-simon-peter-damian-from-nigerian-network-engineer-to-ai-powered-job-search-pioneer), it became clear that Jobago isn’t just another career platform. It's a bet on the future of work or, more accurately, the collapse of it.

### Outplacement, Reimagined

While traditional outplacement services have existed for decades, often tied to expensive, corporate-led coaching, they’re increasingly seen as impersonal and ineffective. Jobago challenges this model head-on.

Roy, Jobago’s founder, frames the current era as one defined by structural job loss, not cyclical unemployment. He draws from the likes of Anthropic’s CEO Dario Amodei, who predicts a “jobs bloodbath” in the near future as AI automates white-collar roles en masse. From this perspective, Jobago isn’t just an outplacement company. It's preparing for a world where permanent 20 to 30 percent unemployment may be the norm.

> “The question isn’t just ‘how do we help people find jobs,’” Roy says. “It’s what do we do when there are no jobs at all?”

### Why Jobago Stands Out

What makes Jobago unique isn’t just its ideology. It’s the execution. Roy has deliberately avoided the bloated, expensive model of firms like LHH (owned by Adecco) or VelvetJobs. Instead, Jobago is being built as a lightweight, scalable, and accessible platform that gives displaced employees tools, not empty promises.

Rather than relying on traditional coaching or long-term one-on-one services, Jobago focuses on:

- Resume editing and LinkedIn optimization
- Job search and AI-powered matching
- Interview preparation
- Self-serve onboarding for companies looking to support laid-off staff affordably

Jobago isn’t trying to be everything. It’s trying to be _enough_ at the right price, with the right level of self-service. Roy calls this “digitallacement” or “AI replacement”, terms meant to bridge today’s HR language with tomorrow’s challenges.

### B2B First, With a PLG Twist

Interestingly, while Jobago is focused on B2B partnerships, it’s not structured like a typical enterprise sales platform. Roy acknowledges the challenge:

> “If you price it affordably say \$99 or \$250, you can’t justify a long B2B sales cycle. But if you go for high-ticket clients, you're in a year-long procurement dance with companies like JPMorgan.”

This tension is at the heart of Jobago’s strategy: Can you build a product-led growth (PLG) model for outplacement? One that HR teams can deploy instantly, without a lengthy sales process, even in sensitive legal contexts like layoffs?

It’s not easy, but it’s the path Jobago is charting. One that could ultimately democratize access to support after job loss.

### What Comes Next?

Jobago remains lean, experimental, and adaptable. Roy admits that things could shift based on client feedback. Transparency for employers, for instance, showing how departing employees are doing is still under consideration. But he’s wary of overpromising. “At \$500 or \$99, you're not getting white-glove support,” he says. “You’re getting a tool.”

In an industry with little innovation, Jobago is asking fundamental questions:

- What does dignity look like for laid-off employees?
- Can AI-powered platforms offer real, affordable value without human coaches?
- Is the solution even “finding jobs,” or just helping people survive without one?

It’s a bold direction, and one that might feel uncomfortable to legacy players in the space. But as the economy changes and white-collar work faces unprecedented automation, **Jobago could be one of the few companies truly ready for what’s coming.**
